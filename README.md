Hello! I'm **Gower Campbell**, and this is my GitHub, a repository of myself for you to see the expanse of technical skills I've built from the intersection of storytelling and software, where creativity meets code. 

My mission is to explore the creative and the technical uses of programming. To create data sheets that will tell their stories and forge tools/web applications that help others, providing access where I can't, and assist others on this journey ahead.

### Current Orbit: Skills in Development
<ul>
  <li> <b>Python Development:</b> Mastering advanced Python concepts, from OOP structures to building interactive apps with arrays, modules and scripts all while utilizing self-created assets.</li>
  <li> <b>(New Skill) Web Development:</b> Embarking on a journey into web development, crafting portals with HTML, CSS, and PHP to leave my mark on the cyberverse.</li>
  <li> <b>SQL & Django Development:</b> Constructing databases using data so that I can integrate them into web projects, adding creative features and tools for clients in the future.</li>
  <li><b>(New Skill) Javascript Development:</b>Venturing into frameworks like jQuery and Node.js to develop scalable front-end and back-end applications, creating interfaces in harmony with my Python modules. </li>
</ul>

## A Galactic Showcase:

### Featured Developer Projects

 - **[StickyNotes](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/MyCodingTask_StickyNote):** A Django app for organizing notes with a sleek interface, perfect for keeping your thoughts in orbit.
- **[Task Manager](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/TaskManager):** A CLI-based task tracker using Python, ensuring no mission goes unaccomplished.

### Data Analysis Projects

Exploring frontiers by turning raw data into spreadsheets, flowcharts, graphs, and tables. Using datasets across this digital universe, from the vast repositories of public archives found in [**data.gov.uk**](https://www.data.gov.uk/). Using Python's powerful pandas library, I'm charting on courses like [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) to learn how to manipulate information from files to uncover insights and visualize discoveries.

## Learning Trajectory

<em>My learning journey is a constellation of growth, with each resource a vital star guiding me toward a career. </em>

I've built a strong foundation through the [**HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp**](https://www.hyperiondev.com/bootcamps/software-engineering/), earning certifications via [**Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/), and followed structured [**Microsoft Learn career paths**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/). I’m actively engaged with the [**100Devs**](https://100devs.org/about) community led by Leon Noel—collaborating, building, and growing alongside fellow developers on discord. To sharpen my skills for the future, I have started learning data science with [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) a fun data science competition platform and online community so that I can regularly solve coding challenges, which require me to explore datasheets, looking to tell their story. I am also, working slowly through [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/) to get a better grasp on some of the advance uses of python. 

<strong> Each repository I build here for myself is a star in my coding galaxy—together forming a professional, purpose-driven path toward a career. </strong>
