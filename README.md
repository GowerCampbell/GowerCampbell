## 🌌 Stellar Learning Trajectory

My learning journey is a constellation of growth, with each resource a vital star guiding me toward a career in software engineering. I've built a strong foundation through the [HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://www.hyperiondev.com/bootcamps/software-engineering/), earning certifications via [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), and followed structured [Microsoft Learn career paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/). I’m actively engaged with the [100Devs](https://100devs.org/about) community led by Leon Noel—collaborating, building, and growing alongside fellow developers. To sharpen my skills for the technical interview galaxy, I regularly solve coding challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each repository I build is a star in my coding galaxy—together forming a professional, purpose-driven path toward becoming a job-ready software engineer.
